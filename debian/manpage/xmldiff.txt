NAME
  xmldiff - Create a diff for two XML files

SYNOPSIS
  xmldiff [-h] [-v] [-f {xml,diff,old}] [-w] [-p] [-F F]
          [--unique-attributes [UNIQUE_ATTRIBUTES]]
          [--ratio-mode {accurate,faster,fast}] [--fast-match]
          file1 file2

DESCRIPTION
 xmldiff is a library and a command-line utility for making diffs
 out of XML. This may seem like something that doesn't need a
 dedicated utility, but change detection in hierarchical data is
 very different from change detection in flat data. XML type formats
 are also not only used for computer readable data, it is also often
 used as a format for hierarchical data that can be rendered into human
 readable formats. A traditional diff on such a format would tell you
 line by line the differences, but that would not be readable by a human.
 xmldiff provides tools to make human readable diffs in those situations.

OPTIONS
  -h, --help            Display help and exit.
  -v, --version         Display version and exit.
  -f, --formatter       Possible choices: xml, diff, old
                        Formatter selection.
                        Default: "diff"
  -w, --keep-whitespace  Do not strip ignorable whitespace.
                        Default: False
  -p, --pretty-print    Try to make XML output more readable.
                        Default: False
  -F                    A value between 0 and 1 that determines how similar nodes must be to match.
  --unique-attributes   A comma separated list of attributes that uniquely identify a node. Can be empty.
                        Unique attributes for certain elements can be specified in the format {NS}element@attr.
                        Default: "{http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace}id"
  --ratio-mode          Possible choices: accurate, faster, fast
                        Choose the node comparison optimization.
                        Default: "fast"
  --fast-match          A faster, less optimal match run.
                        Default: False

EXAMPLE
  Common usage:

    $ xmldiff file1.xml file2.xml

  Making an output a bit more human readable by structuring it with whitespace:

    $ xmldiff -f xml -p file1.xml file2.xml
