.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBxmldiff\fP is a library and a command-line utility for making diffs
out of XML. This may seem like something that doesn't need a
dedicated utility, but change detection in hierarchical data is
very different from change detection in flat data. XML type formats
are also not only used for computer readable data, it is also often
used as a format for hierarchical data that can be rendered into human
readable formats. A traditional diff on such a format would tell you
line by line the differences, but that would not be readable by a human.
\fBxmldiff\fP provides tools to make human readable diffs in those situations.
